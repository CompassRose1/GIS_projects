Projects created for GIS course

Project 1: Contours. Script that creates contours and slope for a DEM.

Project 2: Script tool that reprojects vector datasets in a folder.

Project 3: Hockey scouting. Creates a separate shapefile for each of the three forward positions (center, right wing, and left wing) within the boundary of Sweden, adds height and weight fields in metric units, and is easily customizable for different hockey scouting needs.

Project 4: Turns GPS readings in a csv file into a polyline dataset showing the path a car followed over the time the data was collected. 

Final project: Script tool to compare dataset statistics. My tool takes two feature classes as input, along with a field name. It checks whether the field is numeric and exists in both feature classes. If both these conditions are met, the tool calculates statistics for that field for both feature classes. Statistics include sum, average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Finally, the tool reports a comparison between the datasets.
